  <h1>Il Bavero</h1>
  <p>Il Bavero Tailoring Service owes its beginnings to the passion for elegance and for sartorial men suits. 
We offer every man that wears a suit the possibility to create the perfect fit.
In a few words, it is our pleasure to deliver our clients a unique piece.
Our goal is to personalise every part of the suit, allowing you to become the designer. 
The process of customising starts from the moment you choose our service: we take the measurements, then you can choose the fabrics and linings, and we finish with the meticulous adjustments to the fit of the jacket and the trouser.
We make made-to-measure and bespoke suits.
We completely customise shirts to order as well as accessories including: ties, pocket squares, boxers, eyeglasses cases, bow-ties. 
<br><br>
Suits, as well as shirts and accessories, are manufactured in our tailoring studios in Italy. 
Our Showroom is located in the center of Rome in Via Cola di Rienzo 28 A/3, you can come every day by booking an appointment.
